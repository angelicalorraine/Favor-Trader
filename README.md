To begin trading, each user will need to log in or sign up and create a user profile. Favor Trader contains an Activity Feed where all user’s favors needs are listed. On the Activity Feed, favors are listed, and a Google API locates the favor based on the home address provided by the user. Users may initiate a trade for a favor listed then select from their own list of favors to exchange.
